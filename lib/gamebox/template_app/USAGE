Description:
    The 'gamebox' command creates a new Gamebox application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

Example:
    gamebox ~/Code/Ruby/weblog

    This generates a skeletal Gamebox installation in ~/Code/Ruby/weblog.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
