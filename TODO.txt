TAKE YOUR PICK:
 - remove stage.yml in favor of Gamebox.configure block sytax?
   Gamebox.configure |gb|
     gb.stages = [ :intro, :main, :credits ]
   end

 - move SVG stuff to its own director
 - move all classes into Gamebox module
 - collision detection performance for tiles?
 - collision detection honoring rotation?
 - highscore upload system (use from chingu) (takes json now)
 - solidify rdocs (including tutorial)
 - collidable "grouping"

EXAMPLES:
 - move to separate repo?
 - nario: 
    error on collision

SOMEDAY:
 - add network manager stub
 - update physical objects to use chipmunk_object.rb

 - make complex Phyiscal behaviors 
  * made up by a group of bodies pinned together
 - physical objects should have bodies and shapes body/shape should be shorthand for bodies.first/shapes.first

 - create a DynamicPhysicalActor that can be built from external verts (SVG)

 - add nice actor debugging
 - add Extra; actor with a short time to live (TTL); useful for special effects (maybe as a behavior)
	
 - optional GUI via Fidgit?
 - gamebox server (content server?)
