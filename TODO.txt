TAKE YOUR PICK:
 - framerate setting should come from Gamebox.configuration.target_framerate?
 - game.yml settings ..                 ^^^
 - nice helpers for testing behaviors
 - update README.rdoc in template app

 - add define_style that defines a bucket of behaviors
 - add helper for has_required_attributes on an actor from a behavior (checking that opts for the behavior has said key)
 - move all classes into Gamebox module
 - collision detection honoring rotation?
 - highscore upload system (use from chingu) (takes json now)
 - solidify rdocs (including tutorial)
 - collidable "grouping"
 - input_manager should accept symbols for look up.. :space => KbSpace
 - ZERO PENDING SPECS

EXAMPLES:
 - move to separate repo?
 - nario: 
    error on collision

SOMEDAY:
 - add network manager stub
 - update physical objects to use chipmunk_object.rb

 - make complex Phyiscal behaviors 
  * made up by a group of bodies pinned together
 - create a DynamicPhysicalActor that can be built from external verts (SVG)

 - add nice actor debugging
 - add Extra; behavior with a short time to live (TTL); useful for special effects
	
 - optional GUI via Fidgit?
 - gamebox server (content server?)
