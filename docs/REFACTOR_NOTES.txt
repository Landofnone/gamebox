TODO:
 - double check actor view mechanism
 - update all gamebox actors
 - update all behaviors 
 - solidify configuration and config_manager

 - ALL specs passing (grep for __END__)
 - fill in pending specs

examples
  - roids
  - princess
  - omg aliens

missing acceptance specs
 - pausing / unpausing
 - showing / drawing actors (can test Z and order)
 - physical collisions (non-chipmunk)
 - chipmunk space


QUESTIONS:
 - adding / removing behaviors? (only from other behaviors?)
 - behavior inheritence? difficult for now; not recommended
